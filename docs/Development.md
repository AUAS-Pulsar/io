# 1 Plan of Action

In this chapter we discuss how we plan to develop this part of the application. Because the requirements for this project are not final, changes to our _Action Plan_ could be made in the future.

## 1.1 Introduction

Creating a free and open source framework that contains the generic algorithms and file handling for astronomical data sets. This framework will be modular. Similar to OpenCV, wherein specific modules can be added and disabled depended on the needs of a project. This framework will be implemented in Python and C++.

## 1.2 Current situation

The eScience Center is in need of an application that is able to both read and write filterbank files. There already is an application in use. However, the current application is outdated and therefore has to be rewritten. The scope of this project is to rewrite a new software stack with updated technology, such as using the GPU which is highly modular and re-usable.

The development of the application is split into multiple parts and distributed over two different teams. Each team is assigned to work on one of these parts and make sure that it completed within the given timeframe. After each part is finished, it has to be merged into the main application.

## 1.3 Mission

The purpose of this part of the project is to read and write filterbank files. We are first required to create this part using Python. And if we are finished with creating this part in Python, we will port it to C and C++.

We plan on using Scrum as our project method. By applying Scrum we are able to make changes, based on the feedback given by our product owners, whenever necessary to the application.

## 1.4 Monitoring performance

In order to monitor the performance of our development our product owners decided to plan weekly reviews. These reviews could be used to discuss the pace of our project. If our product owners are not satisfied with the pace of our development team, we could look at possible improvements.

## 1.5 Risks

* A shortage of knowledge about Python/C/C++
* An inflation of requirements
* A wrong estimation of required development time
* Lack of motivation
