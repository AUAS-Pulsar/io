* As user I want to write filterbank files in my program, so we can write astronomical data in scientific program
* As scientific programmer I want that my filterbank reader performs with very large datasets (+1TB of data), which is often the case in software
* As scientific programmer I want that my filterbank writer performs with very large datasets(+1TB of data), which is often the case in software
